# Exploratory_Data_Analysis
In this project, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset Vg_sales using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. EDA is a critical step in any data analysis or data science project as it helps to understand the data, discover patterns, identify anomalies, and formulate hypotheses.

#Objectives:

Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Explore the structure and summary statistics of the data.
Visualize the distribution of numerical variables using histograms or kernel density estimates (KDE).
Explore relationships between variables using scatter plots, pair plots, or correlation matrices.
Analyze categorical variables using count plots or box plots.
Optionally, create interactive visualizations using Plotly for more dynamic exploration.

#Project Tasks:

Data Loading: Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Data Exploration:
Display the first few rows of the DataFrame.
Get summary statistics of numerical variables.
Check data types and missing values.
Data Visualization:
Create histograms and KDE plots to visualize the distribution of numerical variables.
Generate scatter plots, pair plots, and correlation matrices to explore relationships between variables.
Use count plots and box plots to analyze categorical variables.
Interactive Visualization (optional):
Create interactive scatter plots, histograms, or other visualizations using Plotly for more dynamic exploration.
Documentation and Presentation:
Document the findings and insights obtained from the EDA process.
Prepare a presentation summarizing the key findings, visualizations, and insights.

#Deliverables:

Jupyter Notebook containing Python code for the EDA process.
Presentation slides summarizing the key findings and insights.
Documentation detailing the methodology, visualizations, and conclusions.

#Dataset Selection:
